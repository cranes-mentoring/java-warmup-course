Title: Object-Oriented Programming in Java - Advanced Concepts

## Lesson Two: Advanced Java Programming

### 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Recap of basic OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Overview of the `UsefulObject` class as an example of encapsulation

### 2. Class Design and Structure
- Explanation of the `UsefulObject` class structure
- Usage of private fields and public methods for encapsulation
- The importance of providing meaningful getters and setters

### 3. Equals and HashCode Methods
- Understanding the `equals` method and its role in object comparison
- Implementing the `hashCode` method for efficient hashing
- Explanation of the `Objects` class for null-safe comparison

### 4. Best Practices in Class Design
- Overview of defensive programming practices
- Proper usage of access modifiers (e.g., private, public)
- Guidelines for implementing `equals` and `hashCode` methods

### 5. Common Mistakes and Pitfalls
- Identifying and avoiding common mistakes in class design
- Handling null values and ensuring null safety
- Best practices for designing classes that can be easily extended or modified

### 6. Object Comparison and Immutability
- Introduction to object comparison and the importance of overriding `equals` and `hashCode` for custom classes
- Understanding immutability and its benefits in Java programming

### 7. Advanced Java Concepts
- Concepts of serialization and deserialization
- Introduction to design patterns and their role in software architecture

## Summary
This lesson delves into advanced Java programming concepts with a focus on class design, encapsulation, and object comparison. The provided code for the `UsefulObject` class serves as a practical example, showcasing the implementation of `equals` and `hashCode` methods for proper object comparison. Best practices, common mistakes, and additional advanced topics are covered to enhance your understanding of Java's object-oriented features.
