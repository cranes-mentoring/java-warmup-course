# Java Warmup Course for AQA Team 
### Version 2.0.0 (Last Update 03.10.2024)

Welcome to the Java warmup course designed for the AQA team. This series of lessons aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Java fundamentals and advanced topics. Each lesson comes with classwork, relevant articles, and homework assignments. Let's dive in!

## Lesson 1

### Description:
In this lesson, we cover essential Java concepts such as classes, object-oriented programming (OOP), lambdas, streams, and the 'case' keyword. We'll also explore threads and touch upon the importance of the 'equals' method, along with hints for interviews.
